# web_scrape_data
This code demonstrates how to read in html text from a website, chop it up to get the pieces you want, and plot the data using usmap.

These data are all publicly available, but there is no way to export/download the data from the website. This code lets you loop through ~500 different urls (combination of different states and years of data availability) and download the data from an interactive map. The data are the amount of agricultural subsidies by category (e.g., commodity, insurance) received by each county in the US from 2010 through 2019.
